steps:
1. tshark_cmd.pl
     parse pcap traces
2. retrieve_all_ip.pl
     get all IP adresses in the traces
3. update_geo_asn_table.pl
     update IP to GEO and AS table
4. summarize_geo_asn_table.pl
     gather multiple tables from above and generate 1 single table
5. gen_trace_summary.pl
     preprocess the trace, summarize src->dst info per second
6. sort_ips.pl
     sort and group IPs accordingly
7. gen_tm.pl
     according to the sorting result, generate TM
8. tm_top.m
     select the most popular k venues

9. gen_tm_ap_load.m
     read 3D TM output above and convert to 2D TM by only considering the traffic load of APs.
10. gen_tm_ap_load.pl
     Generate 2D TM as above, but from summarized text file directly.

11. ap_topology.pl
     try to group APs by it's topology.
     it's not complete yet because cannot find the map between AP IP and the topology figure.
